A [vocabulary quiz](https://sharonchoong.github.io/japanesevocab/) for Japanese language learners.

There are lots of vocab quizzes out there already, but I wanted to develop my own percentage completion and Japanese level computation, as a way to grade and motivate.

In "Settings", there is a way to reset the correct answer "scores". Resetting will bring words that were considered done and learned, back into the quiz, to review prior learned material that might have been forgotten.

The vocabulary list comes from [Core 6k](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/s2iop/heres_a_spreadsheet_of_the_6000_most_common/) and [Core 10k](https://community.wanikani.com/t/core-10k-non-wk-sort-by-frequency-spreadsheet/17983).

The vocabulary words link to [Jotoba](https://jotoba.com/), so I can learn more about a word.

The quiz is built using the responsive [Foundation Framework](https://get.foundation/index.html) and JQuery, as well as [WanaKana](https://github.com/WaniKani/WanaKana) for searching vocabulary words.
